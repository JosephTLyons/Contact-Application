# Contact-Application
This is a C++ command line contact application.
I'm writing it merely as a summer coding project to keep my programming skills from dwindling between my semesters.
I'm also writing it because I wanted to learn how to use vectors, which is what this program mostly revolves around.
Also, Its written for Mac only using Xcode with a bit of code that is mac-specific,
so this wont work at all on a PC with the code being how it is.
